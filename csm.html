            <h3>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and computer science that uses data and algorithms to make decisions and predictions without explicit instructions123. Machine learning systems learn from data and feedback, typically becoming more accurate with continual training245. Machine learning powers many features of modern life, such as search engines, social media, and self-driving cars4, and it is useful when the input data is massive or unfeasible to process with a human-written algorithm15. Machine learning models can be trained on different types of data, such as numbers, photos, or text5, and can find patterns or make predictions based on the data</h3>
